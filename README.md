# Neighborhood Map

**Neighborhood Map** is a single page React application featuring some of the venues of Siliguri (my hometown!). This project was created using [Create React App 2.0][1] and the venues were fetched using [Foursquare Api][2].

> Basically this application enable its user to select filtered venues and get specific details regarding it!

###### Running the application in Development Mode

In order to run this application on your local machine, you need **Node.js** and **npm** (comes along with Node.js) already installed. Now, open your terminal (Linux/Mac) or command prompt (Windows) and follow the below steps:

First, clone this repository by typing the following command on your terminal:

```
https://github.com/pbiswas101/Neighborhood-Map
```

Next, navigate to the project repository viz. **Neighborhood-Map** and  type `npm install` which will install all the relevant packages for running the application successfully!

Finally, type `npm start` which will automatically open the application on your default browser. Otherwise, you can navigate to `localhost:3000` for running it on a different browser!

###### Building the application for Production

Here, after installing all the dependencies as mentioned above instead of starting the application locally, just follow the below steps like so:

```
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

The last command will serve the production optimised `build` directory on the port 5000. Now, like many of **serveâ€™s** internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```
serve -h
```
